    "answer::::::mongodb is open source document_oriented dataase that is designed to store a large scale of data and allows you to work with that data very efficiently.it is ctogarised under the nosql.(not only sql).database because the storage and retrieval of data in the mongodb aare not in the form of tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in the most traditional dbsystem.insted,non-relational database use a storage model that is optimised for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "to prevent database from becoming a system-wide bottleneck,speciaaly in high volume environments,no sql database perform in a way that relational database cannot.\n",
    "1)storing large volume of data without structure.\n",

    "         indexing--------------every field in the document is indexed with primary and secondary indices with makes                                      easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of data.if the data is not                                indexed,then db search each document with the specified query which taakes lots of time                                   and no so efficient.\n",
    "         replication-----------mongodb provides high availabilty and redundacy with the help of replication,it creates                                  multiple copies to diff servers so that if one server fails,than the data is retrived from                                another server.\n",
